**User's preferred language**: The user's primary language is English. The next agent MUST respond in English.

**what currently exists?**
A full-stack application has been developed with a FastAPI backend, a React frontend, and a MongoDB database. The core features are implemented, including user authentication, a multi-level product catalog, a postcode-based service check, cart and checkout flows, and admin/customer dashboards. The UI has been iteratively styled to match the user's design requirements, featuring a blue and white color scheme and responsive layouts for mobile and desktop. A database seeding script () is available to populate the application with sample data.

**Last working item**:
- **Last item agent was working:** The agent was attempting to resolve a recurring UI issue by removing all remaining instances of yellow, brown, and tan colors from the application to align with the user's requested blue and white theme. The last screenshot revealed persistent issues with divider lines, headings, and dropdown text.
- **Status:** IN PROGRESS
- **Agent Testing Done:** Y (via screenshot, which confirmed the issue was not fully resolved)
- **Which testing method agent to use?** screenshot tool (for visual verification of UI color changes).
- **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
- **Issue 1:** Residual yellow/brown/tan colors in the UI (P0)

**Issues Detail:**
- **Issue 1:**
  - **Description:** Despite multiple fixes, some UI elements retain unwanted yellow, brown, or tan colors. The user has repeatedly requested a pure blue-and-white theme. The specific remaining problems are:
    1. Yellow divider lines between products on the Order Now page.
    2. Tan/brown text color on the Order Products heading.
    3. Tan-colored text within dropdown menus.
  - **Attempted fixes:** The previous agent modified several files, including , , and individual shadcn components (, , ), as well as page-level components like  and . These fixes were only partially effective, suggesting the root cause is in base styles or component library defaults that have not been fully overridden.
  - **Next debug checklist:**
    1. Inspect  to identify the element rendering the divider between products and change its  color class.
    2. Locate the Order Products heading in  and explicitly set its text color class to a non-tan color (e.g.,  or ).
    3. Examine  and  to find what styles the dropdown items () and override their text color. Check for global styles affecting all text.
  - **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** To satisfy a repeated user request and achieve the desired professional, brand-aligned visual aesthetic.
  - **Status:** IN PROGRESS
  - **Is recurring issue?** Y
  - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend
  - **Blocked on other issue:** None

**In progress Task List**:
- None

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
- **Future Tasks:**
  - **Task 1 (P1):** Implement email notifications for order confirmation and status updates. This was explicitly deferred by the user for a future phase and will require integrating a third-party email service like Resend or SendGrid.

**Completed work in this session**
- **List of all completed tasks with file and method name:**
  - Full-stack application foundation (FastAPI/React/MongoDB).
  - User authentication and JWT implementation ().
  - Multi-level product catalog structure (, ).
  - Admin panel with User, Order, and full CRUD Product Management (, ).
  - Customer dashboard for order history ().
  - Checkout flow with custom collection/delivery scheduling ().
  - UI redesign based on user's  brand images.
  - Responsive design implementation for all major pages.
  - Navigation flow separation between a static Services page and the Order Now product catalog (, ).
  - Logic to hide products until a valid postcode is entered ().
  - Customization of toast notifications for better UX and branding ().

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
- None. The only outstanding issue is the color theme, which is currently in progress.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
- N/A

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Frontend:** React, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn/UI
- **Backend:** FastAPI (Python)
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **Authentication:** JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
- **Architecture:** Single Page Application (SPA) with a RESTful API backend.

**key DB schema**
- **users:** 
- **products:** 
- **orders:** 
- **service_types, categories, subcategories:** Defines the nested product hierarchy.

**changes in tech stack**
- None.

**All files of reference**
- : Contains all backend API logic.
- : Defines global styles and CSS variables critical for fixing the color theme.
- : The Order Now page where some of the color issues (dividers, heading) are present.
- : The component responsible for dropdowns, where color issues persist.
- , : Core admin pages that were the focus of the theming effort.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
- The current method of fixing UI colors by patching individual files is inefficient. A more robust and centralized theming approach should be established in  and  to ensure all components inherit the correct colors, preventing recurring issues.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- The highest priority is to permanently fix the UI color theme. The user is very particular about removing all yellow, brown, and tan colors.
- Investigate the root cause of the color issues in Tailwind CSS configuration or shadcn component base styles, rather than applying more temporary patches.
- Email notifications are a planned future feature, do not implement them unless the user asks again.
- The user has provided many reference images throughout the process; they are a key source of truth for design requirements.
